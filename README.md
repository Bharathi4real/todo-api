# Todo List API with Go and Gin

This repository contains a RESTful API for managing a Todo List, implemented in Go using the Gin web framework. The API follows a typical RESTful architecture, utilizing HTTP methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. JSON is used for data representation, ensuring standardized data interchange.

## Features

- **GET /todos**: Retrieve a collection of all todos.
- **GET /todos/:id**: Fetch a specific todo by its unique identifier.
- **PATCH /todos/:id**: Toggle the completion status of a todo item.
- **DELETE /todos/:id**: Remove a todo from the list.
- **POST /todos**: Add a new todo item to the list.

## Architecture

- **HTTP Methods**:
  - `GET` for retrieving data.
  - `POST` for creating new resources.
  - `PATCH` for modifying resource properties.
  - `DELETE` for removing resources.

- **Data Representation**: The API uses JSON to represent todo items.

- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully, with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages returned to the client.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Go and the Gin framework installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Bharathi4real/todo-api.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-api`
4. Install dependencies: `go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin`
5. Run the server: `go run main.go`
6. Access the API at `http://localhost:9090`.

Feel free to use, customize, and extend this API to meet your specific requirements. Utilize tools like `curl` or Postman to send HTTP requests to the defined routes and interact with the todo list API.
